Each block of the transfer looks like:

in which:
<SOH> = 01 hex
<blk #> = binary number, starts at 01 increments by 1, and wraps 0FFH to 00H (not to 01)
<255-blk #> = blk # after going thru 8080 "CMA" instr, i.e. each bit complemented
				in the 8-bit block number. Formally, this is the "ones complement".
<cksum> = the sum of the data bytes only. Toss any carry.
