Asynchronous, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit.

The protocol imposes no restrictions on the contents of the
data being transmitted. No control characters are looked for
in the 128-byte data messages. Absolutely any kind of data may
be sent - binary, ASCII, etc. The protocol has not formally
been adopted to a 7-bit environment for the transmission of
ASCII-only (or unpacked-hex) data , although it could be simply
by having both ends agree to AND the protocol-dependent data
with 7F hex before validating it. I specifically am referring
to the checksum, and the block numbers and their ones-
complement.
